### Contribution Guidelines

I have very limited resources in terms of handling feedback on my projects. So here are the limitations to keep in mind:

- I only look into **small** PRs that suggest
  - bug fixes,
  - documentation fixes.
- I do not look into PRs that
  - implement new features,
  - refactor/cleanup the code.

*What qualifies as a bug, feature, or refactoring is determined by my interpretation.*

If you want to stir the project in a particular direction in terms of features feel free to fork it, I don't mind.
